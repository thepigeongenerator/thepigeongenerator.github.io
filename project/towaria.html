                <h3>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>In Towaria, your goal is to get as far as you can, survive the waves of monsters which become more and more difficult with each level.
                        Each level has a unique layout so your strategies may adapt based on the level you're playing on.</p>
                    <p>This was a school project to learn about mobile development.</p>
                    The systems others interface with to control different internal processes. This also involved intergrating a lot of code.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>My role within the project</h3>
                <p>I mainly focussed on programming the "behind the scenes" logic of the game, so to speak. Think of the random map generation, or how the save data is structure, saved and loaded.</p>
                <p>Summarised, I made the code which interfaces a lot with other people's code, making their lives easier. This involved some code intergration on my part as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Challenges faced</h3>
                <p>One of the main challenges was figuring out how to communicate with other people, whilst working on the same project. And still have a cohesive codebase.
                    The final code isn't what I'd love it to be, but the product itself I am very happy with.</p>
                <p>A challenge which we thought to run into more than we did, was the limited performance of android.
                    But it seems like all the code we wrote was already quite optimised. Though, this didn't stop us from optimising things further.
                    The main bottleneck is rendering, though that is beyond my knowledge at this time.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Utilised tools</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unity3D</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
