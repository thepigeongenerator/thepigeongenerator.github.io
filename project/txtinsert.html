				<h3>Introduction</h2>
					<p>A command-line utility written in Rust, for establishing a framework to find and replace text
						across files.</p>
					<p>This utility is used on this website to help cut back on repetitive elements, like headers,
						navigation bars or the footer below.</p>
					<p>What lead me to create this tool, was working on this website. Initially I used javascript to
						load in these types of repetitive elements dynamically.
						Though, when switching to TypeScript it created a compilation step in the website deployment. So
						I decided to move this logic to this step as well.
					</p>
					<p>Since I was trying to learn Rust at the time, I decided this was a good project to learn it on.
					</p>

				<h3>How the tool works</h3>
				<p>First, it goes through all the inputted files, trying to match the RegEx which looks for definition
					matches.
					When matched, it uses the groups from the RegEx to extract the different components: name,
					parameters and the value.</p>
				<p>It then uses this data with a second regex, which matches for specific strings which signify that
					something needs to be inserted here.
					It loops through the specified arguments and inputs them in the parameters. Which replaces text
					within the value which will be inserted.
					If either no arguments were given, or all have been inserted in the value, the value is inserted in
					the text.</p>

				<h3>Challenges faced</h3>
				<p>This was the first application I wrote in Rust, so naturally a lot of the challenges I faced were
					tied to that.</p>
				<p>Things like learning about ownership and borrowing, the unique syntax and way of working. It isn't
					too different from what I am used to, but different enough to throw me off balance.</p>
				<p>I am still in the process of learning, though I believe I have now exhausted this project from it's
					learning capabilities.</p>
				<p>Another large challenge was figuring out how RegEx worked again, it has been a while since I used it
					to this extend. Though, me frequently using it due to me using Linux does help a ton.</p>
