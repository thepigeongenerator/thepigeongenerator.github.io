                <h3>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>In this project I created a spaceshooter utilising C# and MonoGame.</p>
                    <p>I split the game up in two components which we shall refer to as "core" and "gameplay".
                        The core assembly is in charge of the behind-the-scenes game logic and data which we will go more in-depth about at <a href="#indepth">What the code is doing</a>.
                        And the gameplay assembly is in charge of the logic and data, which is the part a player would mostly interact with.
                    </p>
                    <p>Two libraries of mine have been used in conjunction with this project: <a href="binaryserializer.html">BinarySerializer</a> and <a href="pixelcontrollayer.html">PixelControlLayer</a>.
                        For the case of "BinarySerializer", this project was concepted whilst developing this project. But was split into it's own module, so I could expand upon it more easily.</p>

                    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                    <p>Once you launch the game, you immediately start playing. If you lose, the game is over and you can restart.</p>
                    <p>An asteroid is periodically spawned at the top of the screen, and will make it's way down. Their speed, location and size is randomised.
                        Occasionally, this asteroid will be marked as "unbreakable". These spawn directly above the player with their texture darkened a lot more than usual to communicate to the player that these cannot be destroyed.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the top left of the window the health is displayed, and the top right is the score and highscore. The highscore is saved when the game is exited.</p>
                    <p>The game contains sound effects for when the player is damaged, the player destroys an asteroid and the game is lost.</p>

                <h3>Challenges faced</h3>
                <p>I found the collision most challenging in this project, as this was new to me. Particularly the maths. I did figure it out, and learned a lot about this type of maths and understand what is happening.</p>
                <p>The rest is stuff I've mostly done already in some form or another in the past. So I was quite comfortable designing the whole structure behind everything.</p>
