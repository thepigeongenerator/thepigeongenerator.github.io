                    <h3>About</h4>
                        <p>My name is Quinn, I am a low-level software engineer. At the very least, I inspire to be. I just love learning about a multitude of subjects, and not the surface level stuff either!</p>
                        <p>I am aware that of the knowledge that I have on software development, there is <i>so much</i> that I haven't learnt yet. However, I do recognise that I tend to go deeper into the material than my peers.
                        <h4>The professional / personal overlap</h4>
                        <p>I strongly agree and stand behind the philosophies of open-source software. I love using GNU/Linux as my operating system of choice.
                        Where within engineering, I focus the most around game development. As I find that the most engaging as I get to be creative as well, and produce a piece of art.
                        That doesn't mean that I don't or won't work in other fields. I can say I am quite interested in system engendering, so take from that what you will.
                        One of the private projects is my home linux server, which I haven't had the chance to talk about much. (due to the current state of the website, this is a call to future-quinn to clean things up a bit)</p>
                        <h4>Hobby's / non-professional interests</h4>
                        <p>Beyond software development do I greatly enjoy photography. I love going for a walk and taking photos of things I find interesting. Or my cat, of course! (I do love my cat Bossa a lot, below a photo of her)
                        I also have a deep intrest in cinema photography. I enjoy listening to music where I listen to artists like Bowie, ELO, Supertramp, I dabble in composing myself every once in a while, but haven't gotten to a point where I am satisfied yet.
                        Although, truth be told, when am I ever satisfied about learning something? I also enjoy gaming, and am proud to admit that as an autistic person I never get fully tired of Minecraft, only breaks of variable length.</p>
                       <h4>My current knowledge and what I am planning to learn</h4>
                        <p>I am currently quite knowledgable in <b>C</b> and <b>C#</b>, <b>python</b> have used often in the past, but the reasons to use it started diminishing a ton as bash scripting does most of what I used it for nowadays (light scripting).
                            I quite dislike working with <b>C#</b>. My experience working with it described in a sentence is: "A bloated, high boilerplate, little system control and object oriented paradigms first language.". OOP is not bad per-say. I believe it gets to shine in the places where it actually is useful, usually it isn't, though.</p>
                        <p>My favourite language at this point by far is <b>C</b>. I am still learning, but I love it's flexibility, minimalism and just how close you work with the hardware.</p>
                        <p>I am planning to tackle <b>x86_64 assembly</b>, as it is an invaluable tool whilst debugging and invaluable to know what is happening further under the hood. I am also planning to learn <b>C++</b> and then <b>Rust</b>.
                        I chose that order because when I got started on <b>Rust</b>, I struggled a lot with the unfamiliar syntax on top of the new concepts. I reconised that <b>C++</b> has some parallels, so getting comfortable in that first is likely a good call.</p>
