				<h3>Introduction</h2>
					<p>A library to allow for setting individual pixels in a MonoGame project. Is easily extendable with
						your own functions for more advanced drawing.</p>
					<p>What lead me to create this library was because I was frustrated that when working with MonoGame
						there was no straightforward method of drawing individual pixels or shapes.
						This is particularly useful when debugging, for drawing colliders, for example</p>
			</div>

				<h3>How the library works</h3>
				<p>The library functions by utilising an internal colour buffer in the pixel control layer. It is
					designed to be extendable so you can modify this buffer in any way you see fit.
					Some default drawers are for drawing a single point using x/y coordinates, a line, a square and a
					circle.</p>
				<p>This extendability is done through C# extensions. The way I've designed it is so someone using the
					library has the same level of control as the drawers that are included in the library.</p>
				<p>The reason why I decided to do it this way, is because I strive to make my code flexible when it
					needs to be. Additionally, I was aware that my implementation of these drawers aren't particularly
					made with performance in mind.
					The entire library isn't the best performance-wise. As drawing a lot of pixels if you have a
					high-resolution can be taxing. But this is fine considering it was only meant to be a debug utility.
				</p>
				<p>Though, I am planning to take a look at my implementation at some point and see how I can increase
					the performance. Especially since I have recently learned more about maths in this area due to
					another project.
				</p>

				<h3>Challenges faced</h3>
				<p>The main struggle behind this was figuring out the maths behind the default extensions for drawing
					the basic shapes. Hence my belief that there is still improving to do on this front.</p>
