				<h3>Introduction</h2>
					<p>This is a project of mine where I created a binary serializer in C#.</p>
					<p>What lead me to make this library was that whilst I was working on another project, I wanted to
						store an integer's actual bytes, not the digits as characters, as you would do with JSON or just
						plaintext.
						I quickly found the endpoints I needed to target. And utilising my knowledge about how low-level
						systems are structured I was able to create something which works quite well.</p>

				<h3>How the library works</h3>
				<h4>Serialization</h4>
				<p>We start out with the type we want to serialize for, a pointer to the buffer in which we store this
					data and the size of said buffer.</p>
				<p>First we check if the type is a primitive type (int, float, bool, etc). We convert directly onto the
					buffer pointer if this is the case.
					Otherwise we check if we're an array, and run the designated logic for that, because arrays are
					actually reference types in C#.
					Last, we loop through the fields where we get the type and size of these, and call ourselves on
					this, increasing the buffer pointer by the size after each type serialized.
					(Which allows us to map to different parts of the array stored in memory, without having to copy a
					bunch of data. This works because arrays are just pointers to the first element.
					Thus changing this first element changes what part of the array we're writing to.)
				</p>
				<p>For arrays, we get the type that the array is made of. For each element in the array, we call the
					previous function, and give the starting point of the array into the pointer.</p>
				<h4>Deserialization</h4>
				<p>Like before, we start out with the type we want to deserialize from and a pointer to the buffer
					array. We don't include the size, as it's not needed.</p>
				<p>Again, first we check for primitive types. Convert immediately if so. Otherwise check for an array
					which implements different logic.
					Then we create an instance of the specified type, utilising a parameterless constructor. And the
					fields will be filled using reflection.
					Where, again, we loop over the different fields and call ourselves with the buffer pointer updated
					with the correct location along the buffer.</p>
				<p>And arrays extract their size stored in the first 4 bytes. And allocate an array of the specified
					type for themselves.
					It then proceeds to get this type's size and writes the value for each index, adding this index
					multiplied by the type's size plus the 4 reserved bytes to the pointer to get the starting location
					of each set of data.</p>
			</div>

				<h3>Challenges faced</h3>
				<p>My main challenge has been trying to deserialize an array. Particularly when stored in a struct.
					As mentioned earlier, arrays are reference types, this means that we don't know for certain how much
					data any given array takes up, as it'll vary with it's size.
					My solution for this was allocating 4 extra bytes per array, to store it's size as a 32 bit integer.
					Strangely, it has to be signed, because in C# everything defaults to i32. Despite systems actually
					using u32 for memory locations. Which is also true for array index.</p>
				<p>Some further challenges where mainly around writing the Unit tests. I have only rather recently
					started writing unit tests for some applications.
					Notably, my txtutil written in Rust uses some unit tests. It's not too challenging, but it's new to
					me, so I wanted to mention it.</p>
