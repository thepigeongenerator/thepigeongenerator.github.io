                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>I am a Dutch student in the Netherlands and have a passion for learning.</p>
                <p>I have extensive knowledge of software development, in which I focus myself in low-level development. When coding in private I love using the language C, it's probably my favourite of which I've tried so far.
                    I agree with the philosophies of open-source software, and love using GNU/Linux as my operating system of choice. I mainly focus myself on game development, where via school I am accustomed to working with Unity and C#.
                    Though, my interests vary widely, and enjoy messing around with my custom home server.</p>
                <p>Outside of Software development I am interested in photography, film and media and the production of said things. I also frequently game in my spare time.</p>
                <p>I am always interested in learning new things, my current ambitions are to study in the direction of psychology after I finish my current course.</p>
                <h4>What I can</h4>
                <p>I quite frequently work with <b>C#</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>Python</b>. But I can relatively quickly learn most languages.
                    I am curious to add <b>C++</b> and <b>Rust</b> to my skillset. My preference in languages lies with strongly typed, curly braced, low memory control languages.</p>
